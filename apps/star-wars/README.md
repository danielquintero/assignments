# Henkel Coding Challenge

## Start Wars Characters (SWC)

SWC is the application implementing the requirements laid out in the assessment given by Henkel to complete the following steps:

- Build a single page app with a list that displays a list of the Star Wars characters and their detailed information. ‚úÖ
- The list should be paginated. ‚úÖ
- 10 characters per page maximum. ‚úÖ
- Every routed view should be linked to its previous route and to the character list route and
preserve the pagination. ‚úÖ
- You do not use NgModules but standalone components. ‚úÖ
- You add a minimal test coverage for unit tests.
- You can handle state management so that if we navigate to a previously
visited routed view, we don‚Äôt need to call the API again. ‚úÖ
- You add a minimal e2e with Cypress. ‚úÖ
- UX/UI is responsive and friendly. ‚úÖ

Extras
- Showcase knowledge of domain driven architecture (DTO's, entities and feature & data-access libraries) ‚úÖ

### Getting started

- Make sure to install dependencies, run `npm install`
- For better dx you can install nx globally `npm i -g @nrwl/cli`, this will allow you to run any nx command from terminal. All possible nx commands are listed toward the end of this file.

### How to run the project

To run WCC simply run `nx serve` or `npm start`, make sure you have installed depedencies `npm i` beforehand.

### Test & lint targets

To run lint and unit test, you can simply run `nx run-many --target=test --all --parallel` or `nx run-many --target=lint --all --parallel` for testing or linting every app/library, respectively.

Integration tests are also available for the features requested. You can run Cypress by `nx run wcc-e2e:e2e --watch`.

## Aproaching the assessment

### General knowledge

For the assessment, I kept in mind the requirements, mentioned above, I used the tools that I am more experienced with and I think have the best DX. Furthermore, I have used some extras to showcase how some organisational challenges e.g.(orchestration of frontend applications, design system, mocking, testing etc) can be addressed with proper tooling (NX monorepo, storybook, miragejs, ngspectator).

### Store

Ngrx is used as state management library. I implemented a facade abstraction layer to decouple stateful components/containers from an specific library implementation as well as to accomodate for a comprenhensible API.

### Styles

To quickly help put together some pleasing UI, I have used Tailwind CSS.

### Domain Driven Design

This is out of scope for the assessment but I thought would be good to share how we could follow a DDD approach, we could generated clients/types from Backend specifications (Swagger, OpenAPI) to enforce the correctness of our frontend applications.

The scenario for this example is simplified, but would not take much more effort to make it a real life example. `packages/dashboard/data-access/src/lib/character-dto.ts` and `packages/dashboard/feature-characters/src/lib/+state/characters.models.ts` shows how we can produce frontend library types from DTO types thanks to Typescript utility types. Besides inferring generated types, we can also generate entire clients (angular services) to fully rely on the Backend contract signature.

## ---------------------- NX Dev Extensions ----------------------

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/images/nx-logo.png" width="450"></p>

üîé **Nx is a set of Extensible Dev Tools for Monorepos.**

## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are our core plugins:

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/react`
- Web (no framework frontends)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/web`
- [Angular](https://angular.io)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/angular`
- [Nest](https://nestjs.com)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/nest`
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/express`
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/node`

There are also many [community plugins](https://nx.dev/nx-community) you could add.

## Generate an application

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are sharable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@fedex/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `nx serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.

### Computation Memoization in the Cloud

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/images/nx-cloud-card.png"></p>

Nx Cloud pairs with Nx in order to enable you to build and test code more rapidly, by up to 10 times. Even teams that are new to Nx can connect to Nx Cloud and start saving time instantly.

Teams using Nx gain the advantage of building full-stack applications with their preferred framework alongside Nx‚Äôs advanced code generation and project dependency graph, plus a unified experience for both frontend and backend developers.
